# Hi! 

I'm Rudy Garceau. I like to fish. The last project I was involved with was a Django Web App for a buddy of mine's stratup business called Aquatech. I'm currently thinking about improving his CRM with an offline mode for mountainous terrain, and whether we can use pandas after creating data in json format from local backed up sql dumps to perform querys and transorm datasets on the fly through a jupyter notebook. That would make it really easy to plot things like geospatial dataframes for cool visualizations based off real time data entered into their CRM out in the field. This could be useful when attempting to locate things like iron veins in water supplies and such in clients basements with limited connectivity...
