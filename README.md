# Hi! 

I'm Rudy Garceau. I like to fish. My last project was a Django Web App for a buddy of mine's stratup business called Aquatech. I'm currently thinking about whether we can use pandas after creating json from sql dumps to perform querys and transorm datasets on the fly through jupyter labs. That would make it really easy to plot things like geospatial dataframes for cool visualizations based off real time data entered into a Django app. This could be useful when attempting to locate things like iron veins in water supplies and such...
